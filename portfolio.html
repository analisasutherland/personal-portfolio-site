        <p>
          Currently, Ana Lisa is powerhousing her way through <a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Software Developers Academy</a> in Seattle!
        </p>

          It is an ongoing process and one that is definitely more about the type of mistakes that she makes and how she learns from these moments.
