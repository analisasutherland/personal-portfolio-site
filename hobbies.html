            <h2>What She Is Usually Found Doing</h2>
            <p>
              Ana Lisa lives for dancing and if she is not found coding or developing, she is dancing (in fact sometimes she is found doing both at the same time).
            </p>
            <p>
              She dances many different styles ranging from Tap to Whacking, but her heart truly lives with Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz. She spends the majority of her time listening, dancing, traveling, and performing all for them.
